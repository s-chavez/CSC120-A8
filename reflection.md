- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a Robot that has human abilities. It can grab an item, drop an item, examine an item, use an item, walk in a given direction, fly to given coordinates, shrink to half its size, grow to double its size, rest, undo an action, deliver an item to a specific person, build an item, and fix an item. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added methods for the Robot to deliver, build, and fix.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It helped to visualize what the user would see when I was testing my methods and creating print statements representing the actions of my Robot.
